 * Description: 
 *   'ultra.hpp' serves as a central include header for the Ultrahand Overlay project,
 *   bringing together a comprehensive suite of utility functions essential for the
 *   development and operation of custom overlays on the Nintendo Switch. This header
 *   provides consolidated access to functions facilitating debugging, string processing,
 *   file management, JSON manipulation, and more, enhancing the modularity and 
 *   reusability of code within the project.
 *
 *   These utilities are designed to operate independently, providing robust tools to
 *   support complex overlay functionalities and interactions.
